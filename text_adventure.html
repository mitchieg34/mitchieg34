You were on a boat, when suddenly you reach the bermuda triangle and a great storm starts to brew. 
With the boat rocking so much you hit your head on the railing and become unconscious. 
When you wake up the sun is shining on your face and the boat feels perfectly still.
You stand up and see that your boat has washed up on the shore of some strange deserted island.
You are starving, dehydrated, and in need of shelter from the sun.
You get out and begin to walk into the jungle.

right_choice2 = '''Feeling dehydrated you run into the lake and begin to drink the water while happily swimming around.'''

You kneel close and collect water in your hands and desperately drink it.
No longer dehydrated you sit under a tree and doze off.'''

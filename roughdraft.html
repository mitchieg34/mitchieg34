		<h3 class="subhead"> My name is Michelle Garcia but my closer friends call me Misha.
		I love playing video games (specifically Smite) however I play other games as well.
		Minions are absolutely adorable and they make my day, I also really like donuts. Yum~
		My favorite male artist is currently the Weeknd and it is my dream to travel to Japan since I love manga and anime. </h3>
